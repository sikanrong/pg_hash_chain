This branch/tag represents my initial work on this repo that was mostly about eductionally figuring out how to use Apache ZooKeeper to achieve consensus between shared-nothing nodes to configure a postgres multi-master cluster with WAL replication. It works, but it's about a thousand times cleaner using the Docker/Kubernetes approach to building and deploying the cluster. 

Saved this work for posterity; it taught me much about Apache ZooKeeper design patterns and usage.
